GNN Scientific Paper Classifier ðŸ§ 
This is an end-to-end machine learning project that uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to classify scientific papers into one of seven subjects based on their citation network. The project is built with PyTorch Geometric and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Live Demo

Features
Graph Neural Network: Implements a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn from the relationships (citations) between papers, achieving high accuracy on the Cora dataset.

Interactive UI: A simple and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that allows for real-time predictions.

Lightweight & Deployable: The trained model is very small (~17 KB), allowing for easy and free deployment on cloud platforms like Hugging Face Spaces. This project successfully addresses the deployment challenges faced with larger models.
